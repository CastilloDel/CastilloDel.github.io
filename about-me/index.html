      <p>Hello!
My name is Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa! I'm a computer engineering student at Universidad de La Laguna. You can see some of my work in my <a href="https://github.com/CastilloDel">GitHub account</a>.</p>
<p>Now I'll tell you some things about me. I always had for certain that I would study something computer related. Ever since my first programming steps (with Python) I have been interested in programming languages, and lately I have also found interest in topics like compilers, computer graphics, AI and data analysis. As a Linux user(now Arch btw), I have learned to appreciate the usefulness of open source software and, also, how important documentation is. </p>
<p>Even though my first steps were in Python, the first language I became proficient with was C++. I have used it a lot for my university classes, and maybe that's why I felt in love with Rust when I discovered it. I'm now a proud Rustacean! Lately I've been using a lot of JavaScript too. And while we can all agree JavaScript has it flaws, its dynamism is sometimes refreshing. I have also used Go, Python, Ruby, Nim, C and R, but I'm not that experienced.</p>
<p>I'm a native spanish speaker, but I also speak english and lately I've been learning german, although it's been tough.</p>
<p>I took part in the 2021 <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC program</a>. I worked in the <a href="https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs/">htsget-rs project</a> collaborating with the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health</a>. You can read more about it <a href="https://castillodel.github.io/my-gsoc-journey/">here</a>.</p>
