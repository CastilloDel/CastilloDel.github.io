december I decided to take part in the Advent of Code. Of course, just programming my way through the AOC wouldn't be as much fun as doing it in a shiny new language. This time I decided to give Haskell a try. I had been doing functional programming in Rust and Javascript for some time and I thought it would be a great moment to finally try the hard stuff. I was eager to use a pure functional language, so the 1st of December I downloaded the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC for friends) and started my completely functional adventure.\nWhere to start🔗\nIn Haskell's official page there wasn't an official guide to learn Haskell, but there were some interesting links. I ended up reading Learn you a Haskell for Great Good, which did teach me a lot and helped me solve most of the problems I had during the AOC. I also read a lot of documentation at Hackage and used Cabal to help me run my programs and manage my dependencies.\nAutomatic currying🔗\nThe first thing that really got my attention was the automatic currying. Functions in Haskell can only accept one argument. Knowing that, it would be fair to ask \"how can you write code with functions only taking one argument?\". The answer relies in Higher Order functions. Here we can see a simple Haskell function with its corresponding signature.\nadd :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a\nadd x y = x + y\n\nIf we take a closer look at the signature, we can see it takes something of a type a which must implement the Num typeclass (more on that later), but then it returns another function a -&gt; a, which is the one that really calculates the final result. This might seem odd at first, but it allows us to do things like this.\nmap (add 1) [1, 2, 3] -- Adds 1 to each element of the list \n\nIn fact, if we know that all operators can be used as functions in Haskell, we can do the following:\nmap (+ 1) [1, 2, 3] -- Adds 1 to each element of the list \n\nWhich also works! \nThis allows to express some operations in a very concise way.\nRust similarities🔗\nComing from a Rust background, another thing I noticed was that lot of the syntax and names were similar to the Rust equivalents. For example, derive means more or less the same in both languages and both use let as a keyword to declare new variables. But the similarities go much deeper than just syntax and names. Rust's traits mimic the behavior of Haskell's typeclasses and Rust's enums also remember Haskell's sum types, which also explains why Rust's Option is so reminiscent of Haskell's Maybe. Furthermore, both languages feature pattern matching and guards. It seems clear to me that Haskell and other functional programming languages really influenced Rust. Of course there are other things that are way different in Haskell. \nHard to read symbols🔗\nHaskell can really differ from other languages, specially when you encounter symbols like $, &lt;$&gt;, !, !! or &lt;*&gt;, which are all commonly used in Haskell. To a newcomer they can be rather disorienting, even if they are easier to write when you already know the meaning. This got me thinking. In the end every language does this, it's just that Haskell forces that limit, resulting in more concise code, but harder to read for people who haven't been exposed to Haskell yet. It is difficult to say at which point the heavy usage of symbols in a language results in hard to read code, even for experienced people in that language. It may even vary with each person. I have read some code in APL and I don't think too many people will get angry at me if I say it is too much when you feel the need for an specific keyboard.\nFunction composition🔗\nOne powerful thing about Haskell is how easy it is to compose new functions using the ones you already have. The . operator allows to write this type of code really easily. One example:\n-- New function that adds 1 to each element of a list and then filters the numbers bigger than 2\nfoo = filter (&gt; 2) . map (+ 1) \n\nOf course, the . operator alone wouldn't achieve this if it wasn't for functions like filter, map or fmap. \nParser combinators🔗\nThroughout the AOC I found some problems when reading the input for the day. Some days the input would be rather complicated and I would struggle to parse it correctly into the data structures I had chosen. That all went away when I stumbled on this page explaining parser combinators. They are really simple to use. For example, imagine we need to parse IPs, we could do the following:\nparseIPv4 :: ReadP IP\nparseIPv4 = do\n  a &lt;- readOctet\n  char '.'\n  b &lt;- readOctet\n  char '.'\n  c &lt;- readOctet\n  char '.'\n  d &lt;- readOctet\n  return $ IPv4 [a, b, c, d]\n  where\n    readOctet = fmap read $ many1 $ satisfy isDigit\n\nIt works mostly in a declarative way. We specify our requirements and then the combinators do their best to find matches with what we specify. In this case we are specifying four octets separated by dots. Each octet is composed by at least one digit and the whole number is parsed to an integer, so the final IPv4 representation is a list with four numbers. Keep in mind that return here doesn't mean the same that in other languages, but rather means the IPV4 we are returning will be wrapped in the ReadP monad (More on monads later).\nOf course, you could say that IPv4 can be expressed in different ways and that parsing them is more complex than what appears here... and you would be right! This is only an example, but it allows me to illustrate how clean and simple parser combinators are.\nIf we also wanted to parse IPv6, it would be as simple as defining the correspondent combinator for the IPv6 and then combining both:\ndata IP = IPv4 [Int] | IPv6 [String] deriving (Show)\n\nparseIP :: ReadP IP\nparseIP = parseIPv4 +++ parseIPv6\n\nThe +++ operator parses the input with both combinators. We can access both results (if they are succesful) when we use the corresponding ReadP. In this case we know an IPv4 will never have the same format as an IPv6.\nI hope I have highlighted how useful parser combinators are. As I said this was really a game changer for parsing the different inputs of the AOC.\nMonads🔗\nThey say it is impossible to talk about Haskell without mentioning monads, so here we are. I had heard about monads, but I never got a clear idea about what they were, so it was nice finally knowing about them. I would lie if I said I know every aspect of them, but I have used a few of them. There are some that are somewhat simple like the IO and Maybe monads. Maybe was the easiest one for me, because of its resemblance with Rust's Option. The idea that a value can be there or not is something rather simple also, even if it does have some important implications. \nFrom the monads I used, the one I had the most difficulties with was the State monad. One important thing about Haskell is that normal functions are pure. They have a certain input and produce a certain output, but they don't store values of any kind. Nonetheless, there are certain cases in which such thing is useful and I happened to be in one of those situations during the AOC. My takeaway is that, even if stateful computations are possible in Haskell, they are harder to do, because they don't align well with Haskell philosophy. I also have to say they probably get way easier with practice and with a better understanding of monads.\nWrapping up🔗\nLearning Haskell while doing the AOC challenges was hard, some days I felt like the language itself was designed for the task I had to do, but other days I just wanted to go back to a \"normal\" language. In the end, it was worth it. Even if I had already programmed in a functional style, Haskell still broke my preconceptions several times and forced me to think in a different manner, which I find really valuable. I really liked Haskell and would like another chance to use it.\nAnd that's it! Hope you liked the post! It was more of a story than anything else, but it's something I wanted to share. If you want to check out my solutions to the AOC, you can do so here.\n","id":"https://castillodel.github.io/aoc-haskell/","title":"Learning Haskell during AOC"},"https://castillodel.github.io/compile-time-evaluation/":{"body":"Evaluating code at compile time is a capability that most, if not all, compiled programming languages possess, even if it can't be directly used by the programmer, but rather applied as an optimization. In this post, we'll explore a bit how to execute code at compile time in Nim, Zig, Rust and C++.\nNim🔗\nIn Nim, we can use the word const to declare a variable that needs to be evaluated at compile time. If we didn't want or can't evaluate something at compile time we will need to use var or let. The following code will result in a list of string representing the numbers between 1 and 100 to be present in the binary.\nconst numbers = toSeq(1..100).map(x =&gt; $x) # $ allows us to transform the numbers to string\nfor num in numbers:\n    echo num\n\nIt's easy to check that's the case. We just need to open the binary with a text editor and check that there is some place where there is a list with all these numbers. Don't worry if there is a lot of strange symbols there! They just mean the binary code there isn't meant to represent ASCII or even UTF characters, but our list of numbers will be there. I found the following, all in the same line and with strange symbols between each number:\n@1@2@3@4@5@6@7@8@9@10@11@12@13@14@15@16@17@18 ... @96@97@98@99@100\n\nNow, that we know the basics we can try to do something funnier. We will try to implement Fizzbuzz (a really famous, but rather simple programming challenge), so that the result is always evaluated at compile time.\nimport std/sequtils\nimport std/sugar\n\nproc fizzbuzz(number: int): string {.compileTime.} =\n  if number mod 3 == 0:\n    result = \"Fizz\"\n  if number mod 5 == 0:\n    result &amp;= \"Buzz\"\n  if result == \"\":\n    result = $number\n\nconst numbers = toSeq(1..100).map(x =&gt; fizzbuzz(x))\nfor num in numbers:\n    echo num\n\nNotice that with this we have introduced some new elements. There is a function call and some mathematic operations. There is also the compileTime pragma, which ensures that this function will only be called during compilation and no code will be generated for it. If we check the resulting binary we will find something like this:\n@1@2@Fizz@4@Buzz@7@8@11@13@14@FizzBuzz@16@17@19@22@23@26@28@29@31 ...\n\nIt works! It almost seems like it was too easy, right? Executing arbritrary code at compile time seems like something really complex. We will continue thinking about that further down the line, but now we feel optimistic and happy because everything has come out nicely.\nBut wait... Why do \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\" and \"FizzBuzz\" only appear once? And why are some numbers missing like 6, 9, 20 and 30???\nEvery number that is missing should be \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\" or \"FizzBuzz\" and these ones only need to appear once, because the same string can be reused. But now we have a new problem, if these strings we have been seeing don't contain \"Fizz\" more than once, then they can't represent the final array, right?. That's true. What we have been seeing are only the preprocessed strings, the array will be made of pointers to the directions of this strings, that way it's possible to reuse the \"Fizz\" string.\nZig🔗\nIn zig we can evaluate code at compile time using the comptime keyword. It should be pretty easy based on our experience with Nim. Something like the following should be enough:\nfn get_fizzbuzz(n: usize) []const u8 {\n    if (n % 15 == 0) {\n        return \"FizzBuzz\";\n    } else if (n % 3 == 0) {\n        return \"Fizz\";\n    } else if (n % 5 == 0) {\n        return \"Buzz\";\n    }\n    return n // missing: convert n to string\n}\n\npub fn main() anyerror!void {\n    const fizzbuzz_numbers = comptime init: {\n        var numbers: [100][]const u8 = undefined;\n        for (numbers) |*val, i| {\n            val.* = get_fizzbuzz(i + 1);\n        }\n        break :init numbers;\n    };\n    for (fizzbuzz_numbers) |n| {\n        std.debug.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{n});\n    }\n}\n\nNotice how we wrap the fizzbuzz_numbers initialization in a comptime block. This should mostly work. We only need to to convert n to a string and we're all set! In Nim it was so easy, surely we can just convert it. Let me search how to do it.\n    return std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, \"{d}\", .{n});\n\nWe can just do something like this! But wait, we need an allocator for this. Why? Well, if we think it through it's clear why. Different numbers need different string sizes to be represented. 10 can be represented in two ASCII characters, but 100 needs three. So this is something that tipycally needs heap allocated memory to work. We don't need to get desperate though! Luckily for us, Zig has our backs!\n    return std.fmt.comptimePrint(\"{}\", .{n});\n\nThe comptimePrint function allows us to do exactly what we need. It performs all the necessary checks at compile time, so the compiled code knows the exact size of the string it needs to handle. This way it can be allocated in the stack. For this to work, we need to mark n as a comptime value, which means it must be known at compile time. The final code would be the following:\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nfn get_fizzbuzz(comptime n: usize) []const u8 {\n    if (n % 15 == 0) {\n        return \"FizzBuzz\";\n    } else if (n % 3 == 0) {\n        return \"Fizz\";\n    } else if (n % 5 == 0) {\n        return \"Buzz\";\n    }\n    return std.fmt.comptimePrint(\"{}\", .{n});\n}\n\npub fn main() anyerror!void {\n    const fizzbuzz_numbers = comptime init: {\n        var numbers: [100][]const u8 = undefined;\n        for (numbers) |*val, i| {\n            val.* = get_fizzbuzz(i + 1);\n        }\n        break :init numbers;\n    };\n    for (fizzbuzz_numbers) |n| {\n        std.debug.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{n});\n    }\n}\n\nIf we repeat what we did with the Nim code, we can also see the corresponding strings in the binary. We can also see it clearly using Compiler Explorer.\nI liked Zig approach, it made the different problems be clear, but also gave us the appropiate tools to overcome them. Nim, on the other hand, just handled everything for us which was really nice. It is also really interesting to look at the source code of the comptimePrint function. It is implemented outside the language, in the standard library, and really takes advantage of Zig's compile time execution capabilities.\nRust🔗\nWe can also try to do the same in Rust! In Rust we use the keyword const to declare a function that can be evaluated at compile time. This restricts the operations we can do. For example, we can't use the String type, because it uses heap allocations. So our function should return a &amp;'static str, which means a reference to a string that lives throughout the entire program (usually because the data is embedded in the binary).\nconst fn get_fizzbuzz_equivalent(number: usize) -&gt; &amp;'static str {\n    if number % 15 == 0 {\n        \"FizzBuzz\"\n    } else if number % 3 == 0 {\n        \"Fizz\"\n    } else if number % 5 == 0 {\n        \"Buzz\"\n    } else {\n        &amp;number.to_string() // Obviously this doesn't work for the reasons we discussed previously\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a nice first approach, but we have the same problem we had with Zig. Notice that Rust also makes the problem really clear, we can't use a String inside a const function. We could use something like const_format to get what we need. We would have the following code:\nuse const_format::formatcp;\n\nconst fn get_fizzbuzz_equivalent&lt;const number: usize&gt;() -&gt; &amp;'static str {\n    if number % 15 == 0 {\n        \"FizzBuzz\"\n    } else if number % 3 == 0 {\n        \"Fizz\"\n    } else if number % 5 == 0 {\n        \"Buzz\"\n    } else {\n        formatcp!(\"{}\", number)\n    }\n}\n\nWe need to declare number as a const generic, to indicate it must be known at compile time(the arguments of a const fn don't need to be known at compile time, if they aren't the function will just run normally at runtime, but we can't call formatcp! at runtime). But even with that, formatcp! doesn't work nicely with const generics. I think it should be possible to do it, but I couldn't find a simple way to do it.\nC++🔗\nC++'s constexpr is similar to Rust's const, so we can do something like this:\nconstexpr char* get_fizzbuzz(int number) {\n    if (number % 15 == 0) {\n        return \"FizzBuzz\";\n    } else if (number % 3 == 0) {\n        return \"Fizz\";\n    } else if (number % 5 == 0) {\n        return \"Buzz\";\n    }\n    return number; // convert to string\n}\n\nAgain, we have the same problem as before. In C++, we can solve it with the to_chars function from the standard library. The downside is that to use to_chars we need to first declare an array with a fixed length. This is, of course, a valid solution, but we could be using some unnecessary bytes. In the Zig and Nim solution we don't need to that because the compiler calculated the actual necessary length.\nConclusion🔗\nI wanted to bring attention to the fact that a lot of operations that we think are really simple, like converting a number to string, aren't actually that simple.\nOf course, there is a lot more to talk about this topic, but I think this rather short post can be interesting to some people. I did learn a lot writing and experimenting about the topic. If you reached the end, thank you!

I had already tried last year and didn't get selected, so it was a bit tough to bring myself to write another one. Luckily this year I found a project in which I would work in Rust, which is, at least currently, my favourite programming language. This helped motivate me and I started preparing my proposal. It wasn't easy, because I was also dealing with assignments from my university and I didn't have much time. After I sent the proposal I kind of forgot about it. I was busy with my classes and didn't think about it much until i knew I got selected! I felt like my efforts were being rewarded, but I had obviously a lot of work left to do.\nThe program🔗\nI worked in the htsget-rs project collaborating with the Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health. I started the day after I finished my exams, the dates aligned perfectly, but that also meant I didn't have a break. Following some tips Google provided I tried to spend roughly 4 hours a day in the project. After a really stressful semester in my degree, 4 hours didn't feel like a lot and it did allow me to finish the project on time while enjoying the development without feeling pressure to work faster. I also felt I had a lot of luck, because my mentor and my partner in the project (who was also a GSoC student) were both awesome to work with and really understanding. If you want to read more about the work itself, here you can find a wrap-up my mentor wrote. \nResults🔗\nI really liked my experience in the program and would recommend it to anyone.
