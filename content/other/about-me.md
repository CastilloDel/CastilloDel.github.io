Hello!
My name is Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa! I'm a computer engineering student at Universidad de La Laguna. You can see some of my work in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/CastilloDel).

Now I'll tell you some things about me. I always had for certain that I would study something computer related. Ever since my first programming steps (with Python) I have been interested in programming languages, and lately I have also found interest in topics like compilers, computer graphics, AI and data analysis. As a Linux user(now Arch btw), I have learned to appreciate the usefulness of open source software and, also, how important documentation is. 

Even though my first steps were in Python, the first language I became proficient with was C++. I have used it a lot for my university classes, maybe that's why I felt in love with Rust when I discovered it. I'm now a proud Rustacean! Lately I've been using a lot of JavaScript too. And while we can all agree JavaScript has it flaws, its dinamicity is sometimes refreshing. I have also used Go, Python, Ruby, C and R, but I'm not that experienced in those languages.

If talking about different things than programming languages, I could tell you that my native language is spanish, but I also speak english and lately I've been learning german.
