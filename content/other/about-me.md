Hello!
My name is Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa! I'm a computer engineering student at Universidad de La Laguna. You can see some of my work in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/CastilloDel).

Now I'll tell you some things about me. I always had for certain that I would study something computer related. Ever since my first programming steps (with Python) I have been interested in programming languages, and lately I have also found interest in topics like compilers, computer graphics, AI and data analysis. As a Linux user(now Arch btw), I have learned to appreciate the usefulness of open source software and, also, how important documentation is. 

Even though my first steps were in Python, the first language I became proficient with was C++. I have used it a lot for my university classes, maybe that's why I felt in love with Rust when I discovered it. I'm now a proud Rustacean! Lately I've been using a lot of JavaScript too. And while we can all agree JavaScript has it flaws, its dinamicity is sometimes refreshing. I have also used Go, Python, Ruby, Nim, C and R, but I'm not that experienced.

I'm a native spanish speaker, but I also speak english and lately I've been learning german.

I took part in the 2021 [GSoC program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I worked in the [htsget-rs project](https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs/) collaborating with the [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/). You can read more about it [here](@/my_gsoc_journey.md).
