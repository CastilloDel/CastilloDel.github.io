This year I took part in the [GSoC program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I'm so happy with how it turned out and the experience as a whole. If you want to know about it, keep reading!

## Getting selected
Making a good proposal was difficult for me. I had already tried last year and didn't get selected, so it was a bit tough for me to bring myself to write another one. Luckily this year I found a project in which I would work in Rust, which is, at least currently, my favourite programming language. This helped motivate me and I started preparing my proposal. That wasn't easy either, because I was also dealing with assignments from my university and I didn't have much time. I sent the proposal and then I kind of forgot about it. I was busy with my classes and didn't think about it much until i knew I got selected! I felt like my efforts were being rewarded, but I had a lot of work left to do.

## The program
I worked in the [htsget-rs project](https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs/) collaborating with the [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/). I started the day after I finished my examens, the dates aligned perfectly, but that also meant I didn't have a break. Following the [some tips Google provided](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/time-management-for-students) I tried to spend roughly 4 hours a day in the project. After a really stressful semester in my degree 4 hours didn't feel like a lot and it did allow me to finish the project on time while enjoying the development without feeling pressure to work faster. I also felt I had a lot of luck, because my mentor and my partner in the project (who was also a GSoC student) were both awesome to work with and really understanding. If you want to read more about the work itself, [here](https://umccr.org/blog/htsget-rs/) you can find a wrap-up my mentor wrote. 

## Results
I really like my experience in the program and would recommend it to anyone. I would also like to repeat next year if possible.
